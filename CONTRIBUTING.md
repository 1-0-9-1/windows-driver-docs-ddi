# Contributing to Windows Driver Reference Documentation

This page covers the basic steps for contributing to the Windows driver reference documentation.

## Architecture

The reference docs are generated by merging syntax block info (function signatures, etc.) from Windows headers with descriptions and remarks stored in the *.md files in this repo.
Because some of each page is auto-generated from the headers, changes to the following sections will be discarded:   

    *  Headings
    *  Syntax tokens
    *  Requirements
    *  YAML block

*more info coming*

## See Also

The driver conceptual info is stored in a separate repo: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-driver-docs
