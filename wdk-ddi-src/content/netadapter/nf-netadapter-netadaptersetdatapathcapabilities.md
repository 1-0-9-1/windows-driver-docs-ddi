Sets the data path capabilities of the network adapter.

## -parameters

### -param Adapter
The network adapter object that the client created in a prior call to [NetAdapterCreate](nf-netadapter-netadaptercreate.md).

### -param TxCapabilities
A pointer to an allocated and initialized [NET_ADAPTER_TX_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_tx_capabilities.md) structure.

### -param RxCapabilities
A pointer to an allocated and initialized [NET_ADAPTER_RX_CAPABILITIES](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_rx_capabilities.md) structure.

## -returns
This method does not return a value.

## -remarks
The client driver must call this method from its *[EVT_NET_ADAPTER_SET_CAPABILITIES](nc-netadapter-evt_net_adapter_set_capabilities.md)* event callback routine.

This method, along with a few other set capability methods (see below), is the replacement for the [NDIS_MINIPORT_ADAPTER_GENERAL_ATTRIBUTES](../ndis/ns-ndis-_ndis_miniport_adapter_general_attributes.md) union that a (non-WDF) client of Ndis.sys sets by calling [NdisMSetMiniportAttributes](../ndis/nf-ndis-ndismsetminiportattributes.md).
