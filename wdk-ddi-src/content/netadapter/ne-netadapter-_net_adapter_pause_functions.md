The **NET_ADAPTER_PAUSE_FUNCTIONS** enumeration is used to specify pause frame support in the [NET_ADAPTER_LINK_STATE](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_link_state.md) structure.

An initialized [NET_ADAPTER_LINK_STATE](ns-netadapter-_net_adapter_link_state.md) structure is an input to [NetAdapterSetCurrentLinkState](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetcurrentlinkstate.md).

The minimum NetAdapterCx version for **NET_ADAPTER_PAUSE_FUNCTIONS** is 1.0.
