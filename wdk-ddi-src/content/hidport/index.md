# Hidport.h header



This header is used by Human Interface Devices (HID). For more information, see
- [Human Interface Devices (HID)](../_hid/index.md)

This section describes the system-supplied routines that user-mode applications, kernel-mode drivers, and HID minidrivers use to operate devices in the HIDClass device setup class.

As a general rule, user-mode applications can use the HidD_Xxx and HidP_Xxx routines. However, kernel-mode drivers can only call HidP_Xxx routines. 

HID minidrivers use only the HidRegisterMinidriver routine.

For WindowsÂ 8.1 Microsoft introduced the new Windows.Devices.HumanInterfaceDevice API which lets you write Windows apps that  access HID devices.

The header  defines  IOCTLs that a HID minidriver must support. Only the HID class driver sends these IOCTLs to a HID minidriver. User-mode applications and other kernel-mode  drivers can  only communicate with HID collections by using the HIDClass support routines and HID class driver ioctls.
