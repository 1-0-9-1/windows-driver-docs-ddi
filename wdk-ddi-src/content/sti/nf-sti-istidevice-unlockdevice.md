# IStiDevice::UnLockDevice method


## -description


The <b>IStiDevice::UnLockDevice</b> method unlocks a device that was locked by a previous call to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543756">IStiDevice::LockDevice</a>.


## -syntax


````
HRESULT UnLockDevice();
````


## -parameters





## -returns


If the operation succeeds, the method returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in <i>stierr.h</i>.



## -remarks


Before the <b>IStiDevice::UnLockDevice</b> method releases the <b>IStiDevice</b>-level lock on the device, it calls <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543843">IStiUSD::UnLockDevice</a> in the appropriate vendor-supplied minidriver.

Before calling <b>IStiDevice::UnLockDevice</b>, clients of the <b>IStiDevice</b> COM interface must call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff543778">IStillImage::CreateDevice</a> to obtain an <b>IStiDevice</b> interface pointer, which provides access to a specified device.
