# NdisMCmDeregisterSapComplete macro


## -description


<b>NdisMCmDeregisterSapComplete</b> returns the final status of a client's request, for which the MCM driver
  previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING, to deregister a SAP.


## -parameters




### -param _S_

TBD


### -param _H_

TBD






#### - NdisSapHandle [in]

Specifies the handle identifying the SAP.


#### - Status [in]

Specifies NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS.


## -remarks



<b>NdisMCmDeregisterSapComplete</b> notifies both NDIS and the client that the MCM driver has completed
    the SAP-deregistration request for which its 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/738c426e-aa4f-4f59-b955-fbf67071303f">
    ProtocolCmDeregisterSap</a> function previously returned NDIS_STATUS_PENDING.

A call to 
    <b>NdisMCmDeregisterSapComplete</b> causes NDIS to call the client's 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/93f8f74a-8ad4-42ea-83cf-ddfcd7f55ce6">
    ProtocolClDeregisterSapComplete</a> function.

The MCM driver should consider the 
    <i>NdisSapHandle</i> invalid when 
    <b>NdisMCmDeregisterSapComplete</b> returns control.

Only connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support can call 
    <b>NdisMCmDeregisterSapComplete</b>. Stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS as
    protocol drivers, call 
    <b>NdisCmDeregisterSapComplete</b> instead.
