# NdisMCmDispatchCallConnected macro


## -description


<b>NdisMCmDispatchCallConnected</b> notifies NDIS and the client that data transfers can begin on a VC that
  the MCM driver created for an 
  <i>incoming</i> call initiated on a remote node.


## -parameters




### -param _H_

TBD






#### - NdisVcHandle [in]

Specifies the handle to the VC that represents the connection, created with 
     <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff562812">NdisMCmCreateVc</a> when the MCM driver set
     up the VC for the incoming call.


## -remarks



An MCM driver's 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/353e929b-17c8-47e8-82fd-b646e93a5b9a">
    ProtocolCmIncomingCallComplete</a> function calls 
    <b>NdisMCmDispatchCallConnected</b> to complete the final handshake for an incoming call from a remote
    node, which the local client has already accepted.

A call to 
    <b>NdisMCmDispatchCallConnected</b> causes NDIS to call the client's 
    <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/675b2066-6a65-47cf-bde7-3c843f97c960">
    ProtocolClCallConnected</a> function.

Only connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support can call 
    <b>NdisMCmDispatchCallConnected</b>. Stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS as
    protocol drivers, call 
    <b>NdisCmDispatchCallConnected</b> instead.
