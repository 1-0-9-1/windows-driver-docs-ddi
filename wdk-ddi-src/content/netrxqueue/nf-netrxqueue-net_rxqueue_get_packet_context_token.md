The **NET_RXQUEUE_GET_PACKET_CONTEXT_TOKEN** macro retrieves the token identifier for a packet context, for receive queues that use more than one packet context.

## -parameters

### -param _rxqueue
A handle to the NETRXQUEUE object.

### -param _contexttype
The structure type name of a driver-defined structure that describes the contents of the packet's context space.

## -remarks
Queues with more than one packet per context require a **NET_PACKET_CONTEXT_TOKEN** to identify and retrieve each context. Call **NET_RXQUEUE_GET_PACKET_CONTEXT_TOKEN** to retrieve the token for a context type if your receive queue uses more than one context per packet.

For an example of how to use this macro to retrieve a packet context token, see [NET_PACKET_DECLARE_CONTEXT_TYPE_WITH_NAME](../netadapterpacket/nf-netadapterpacket-net_packet_declare_context_type_with_name.md).
