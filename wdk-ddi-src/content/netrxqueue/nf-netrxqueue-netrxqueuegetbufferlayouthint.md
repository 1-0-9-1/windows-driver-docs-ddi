The **NetRxQueueGetBufferLayoutHint** method queries buffer layout hints that a net receive queue can use to calculate how much padding its receive buffers should have.

## -parameters

### -param NetRxQueue
A handle to a NETRXQUEUE object obtained from a prior call to [NetRxQueueCreate](nf-netrxqueue-netrxqueuecreate.md).

### -param BufferLayoutHint
A [NET_RXQUEUE_BUFFER_LAYOUT_HINT](ns-netrxqueue-_net_rxqueue_buffer_layout_hint.md) structure that represents the buffer layout hints returned from the upper layer.

## -returns
This method does not return a value.

## -remarks
Call this method to obtain buffer layout hints from the upper layer, formatted as a [NET_RXQUEUE_BUFFER_LAYOUT_HINT](ns-netrxqueue-_net_rxqueue_buffer_layout_hint.md) structure. While this method is optional for client drivers to call, it can help improve receive queue performance by ensuring that protocol headers are naturally aligned.

The minimum NetAdapterCx version for **NetRxQueueGetBufferLayoutHint** is 1.1.
