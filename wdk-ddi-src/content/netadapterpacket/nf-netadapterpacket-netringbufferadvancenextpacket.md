Increments the NextIndex value of the ring buffer, then returns a pointer to the packet at the new NextIndex value.

## -parameters

### -param RingBuffer
A pointer to a [NET_RING_BUFFER](../netringbuffer/ns-netringbuffer-_net_ring_buffer.md).

## -returns
Returns **NULL** if the ring buffer's **NextIndex** equals its **EndIndex**, meaning there are no more unprocessed packets. Otherwise, this routine returns a pointer to the [NET_PACKET](../netpacket/ns-netpacket-_net_packet.md) at the new **NextIndex** value of the ring buffer.

## -remarks
Typically, your driver would use NetRingBufferAdvanceNextPacket in a loop to issue packets to hardware.

For example:

```c++
NET_PACKET *nextPacket;
while (NULL != (nextPacket = NetRingBufferAdvanceNextPacket(ringBuffer))) {
  ProgramPacketToMyHardware(nextPacket);
}
```

For more info, see [Transferring Network Data](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/transferring-network-data).

The minimum NetAdapterCx version for **NetRingBufferAdvanceNextPacket** is 1.0.
