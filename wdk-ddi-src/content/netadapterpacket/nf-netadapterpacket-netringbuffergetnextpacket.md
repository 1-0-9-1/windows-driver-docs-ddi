Returns a pointer to the packet in a ring buffer at the ring buffer's **NextIndex** index value.

## -parameters

### -param RingBuffer
A pointer to a [NET_RING_BUFFER](../netringbuffer/ns-netringbuffer-_net_ring_buffer.md).

## -returns
Returns **NULL** if the ring buffer's **NextIndex** equals its **EndIndex**, meaning there are no more unprocessed packets. Otherwise, this routine returns a pointer to the [NET_PACKET](../netpacket/ns-netpacket-_net_packet.md) at the new **NextIndex** value of the ring buffer.

## -remarks
This routine is similar to [NetRingBufferAdvanceNextPacket](nf-netadapterpacket-netringbufferadvancenextpacket.md). The difference is that this routine does not modify the ring buffer's **NextIndex** field; the ring buffer is not modified.

Typically, your driver would use **NetRingBufferGetNextPacket** to get the next packet to program into hardware. Because **NetRingBufferGetNextPacket** does not increment **NextIndex**, you'll also eventually need to increment the index. For example:

```c++
NET_PACKET *nextPacket;
while (NULL != (nextPacket = NetRingBufferGetNextPacket(ringBuffer))) {
  if (!EnoughMemoryAvailableForPacket(nextPacket))
    break;

    ProgramPacketToMyHardware(nextPacket);
    NetRingBufferAdvanceNextPacket(ringBuffer);
}
```

For more info, see [Transferring Network Data](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/transferring-network-data).

The minimum NetAdapterCx version for **NetRingBufferGetNextPacket** is 1.0.
