Description




USBD_ENDPOINT_OFFLOAD_MODE



Defines values for endpoint offloading options in the USB device or host controller.





USBD_ENDPOINT_OFFLOAD_INFORMATION



Stores xHCI-specific information that is used by client drivers to transfer data to and from the offloaded endpoints.





_URB_BULK_OR_INTERRUPT_TRANSFER



The _URB_BULK_OR_INTERRUPT_TRANSFER structure is used by USB client drivers to send or receive data on a bulk pipe or on an interrupt pipe.





_URB_CONTROL_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST



The _URB_CONTROL_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST structure is used by USB client drivers to get or set descriptors on a USB device.





_URB_CONTROL_FEATURE_REQUEST



The _URB_CONTROL_FEATURE_REQUEST structure is used by USB client drivers  to set or clear features on a device, interface, or endpoint.





_URB_CONTROL_GET_CONFIGURATION_REQUEST



The _URB_CONTROL_GET_CONFIGURATION_REQUEST structure is used by USB client drivers to retrieve the current configuration for a device.





_URB_CONTROL_GET_INTERFACE_REQUEST



The _URB_CONTROL_GET_INTERFACE_REQUEST structure is used by USB client drivers to retrieve the current alternate interface setting for an interface in the current configuration.





_URB_CONTROL_GET_STATUS_REQUEST



The _URB_CONTROL_GET_STATUS_REQUEST structure is used by USB client drivers to retrieve status from a device, interface, endpoint, or other device-defined target.





_URB_CONTROL_TRANSFER



The _URB_CONTROL_TRANSFER structure is used by USB client drivers to transfer data to or from a control pipe.





_URB_CONTROL_TRANSFER_EX



The _URB_CONTROL_TRANSFER_EX structure is used by USB client drivers to transfer data to or from a control pipe, with a timeout that limits the acceptable transfer time.





_URB_CONTROL_VENDOR_OR_CLASS_REQUEST



The _URB_CONTROL_VENDOR_OR_CLASS_REQUEST structure is used by USB client drivers to issue a vendor or class-specific command to a device, interface, endpoint, or other device-defined target.





_URB_GET_CURRENT_FRAME_NUMBER



The _URB_GET_CURRENT_FRAME_NUMBER structure is used by USB client drivers to retrieve the current frame number. 





_URB_GET_ISOCH_PIPE_TRANSFER_PATH_DELAYS



The _URB_GET_ISOCH_PIPE_TRANSFER_PATH_DELAYS structure is used by USB client drivers to retrieve delays associated with isochronous transfer programming in the host controller and transfer completion so that the client driver can ensure that the device gets the isochronous packets in time. 






_URB_HEADER



The _URB_HEADER structure is used by USB client drivers to provide basic information about the request being sent to the host controller driver.





_URB_ISOCH_TRANSFER



The _URB_ISOCH_TRANSFER structure is used by USB client drivers to send data to or retrieve data from an isochronous transfer pipe.





_URB_OPEN_STATIC_STREAMS



The _URB_OPEN_STATIC_STREAMS structure is used by a  USB client driver to open streams in the specified bulk endpoint. 





_URB_OS_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST



The _URB_OS_FEATURE_DESCRIPTOR_REQUEST structure is used by the USB hub driver to retrieve Microsoft OS Feature Descriptors from a USB device or an interface on a USB device.





_URB_PIPE_REQUEST



The _URB_PIPE_REQUEST structure is used by USB client drivers to clear a stall condition on an endpoint.





_URB_SELECT_CONFIGURATION



The _URB_SELECT_CONFIGURATION structure is used by client drivers to select a configuration for a USB device.





_URB_SELECT_INTERFACE



The _URB_SELECT_INTERFACE structure is used by USB client drivers to select an alternate setting for an interface or to change the maximum packet size of a pipe in the current configuration on a USB device.





URB



The URB structure is used by USB client drivers to describe USB request blocks (URBs) that send requests to the USB driver stack. The URB structure defines a format for all possible commands that can be sent to a USB device.





USB_CONTROLLER_FLAVOR



The USB_CONTROLLER_FLAVOR enumeration specifies the type of USB host controller.





USBD_INTERFACE_INFORMATION



The USBD_INTERFACE_INFORMATION structure holds information about an interface for a configuration on a USB device.





USBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR



The USBD_ISO_PACKET_DESCRIPTOR   structure is used by USB client drivers to describe an isochronous transfer packet.





USBD_PIPE_INFORMATION



The  USBD_PIPE_INFORMATION structure is used by USB client drivers to hold information about a pipe from a specific interface.





USBD_PIPE_TYPE



The USBD_PIPE_TYPE enumerator indicates the type of pipe.





USBD_STREAM_INFORMATION



The USBD_STREAM_INFORMATION structure stores information about a stream associated with a bulk endpoint.





USBD_VERSION_INFORMATION



The USBD_VERSION_INFORMATION structure is used by the GetUSBDIVersion function to report its output data.
