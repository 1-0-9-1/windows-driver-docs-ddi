The reference pages in this section describe wireless display (Miracast) user-mode functions that the operating system  implements. Only Miracast user-mode drivers can call these functions. For functions that the Miracast user-mode driver implements, see Wireless Display (Miracast) Functions Implemented By User-Mode Drivers.

Pointers to the Miracast display callback functions are returned in a MIRACAST_CALLBACKS structure.
