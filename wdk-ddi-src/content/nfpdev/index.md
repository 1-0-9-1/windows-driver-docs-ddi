# Nfpdev.h header



This header is used by Near field communications (NFC). For more information, see
- [Near field communications (NFC)](../_nfpdrivers/index.md)

This section contains the DDI reference for proximity drivers, which enable near-field communication between two devices by establishing a connection between peer applications. For more information about Tap and Do, the NFP provider model and the NFP device driver requirements, see the Near field proximity design guide.
