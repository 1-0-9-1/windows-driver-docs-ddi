Arguments used in the [DxgkddiSuspendContext](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_suspendcontext.md) callback function.

## -struct-fields

### -field hContext

The hardware context to be preempted and marked as suspended. This type of preemption request does not have a grace period, and is expected to be honored by the GPU as soon as possible.

### -field contextSuspendFence

A monotonically increasing per-context value that will be reported by the GPU context suspended interrupt once the preemption request is completed. Until the fence is signaled, the OS cannot assume GPU is suspended.

## -remarks

The context suspend fence value is necessary to handle cases when the OS suspends a context, doesnâ€™t wait for the suspend fence acknowledgment, resumes, and suspends a context again. The suspend fence value will allow the OS to distinguish between the previous suspend acknowledgement and the latest one.
