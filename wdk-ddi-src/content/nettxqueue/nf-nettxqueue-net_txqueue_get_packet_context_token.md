# NET_TXQUEUE_GET_PACKET_CONTEXT_TOKEN macro

The **NET_TXQUEUE_GET_PACKET_CONTEXT_TOKEN** macro retrieves a **NET_PACKET_CONTEXT_TOKEN** for a [NET_PACKET](../netpacket/ns-netpacket-_net_packet.md) context based on the supplied context type name.

## -parameters

### -param _txqueue
A handle to the NETTXQUEUE object.

### -param _contexttype
The structure type name of a driver-defined structure that describes the contents of the packet's context space.

## -remarks
In NetAdapterCx 1.1, the ability to add more than one packet context was introduced, meaning queues with more than one packet per context now require a **NET_PACKET_CONTEXT_TOKEN** to identify and retrieve each context. Call **NET_TXQUEUE_GET_PACKET_CONTEXT_TOKEN** to retrieve the token for a context type if your transmit queue uses more than one context per packet.

For an example of how to use this macro to retrieve a packet context token, see [NET_PACKET_DECLARE_CONTEXT_TYPE_WITH_NAME](../netadapterpacket/nf-netadapterpacket-net_packet_declare_context_type_with_name.md).

The minimum NetAdapterCx version for **NET_TXQUEUE_GET_PACKET_CONTEXT_TOKEN** is 1.1.
